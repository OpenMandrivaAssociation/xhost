%description
The xhost program is used to add and delete host names or user names to the
list allowed to make connections to the X server. In the case of hosts, this
provides a rudimentary form of privacy control and security. It is only
sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment, although it does limit
the worst abuses. Environments which require more sophisticated measures should
implement the user-based mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for passing
other authentication data to the server.
